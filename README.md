# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using three machine learning models: Linear SVM, Logistic Regression, and a Neural Network. The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and contains 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are fraudulent.

## Models Used
- **Linear SVM**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Neural Network**

## Results
Each model was evaluated with a focus on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score. The Neural Network performed best in identifying fraudulent transactions, making it the most effective model for this task.
